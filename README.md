## Food Truck project
My second weekend project for Skill Distillery.

### Overview

This is a console based app that lets the user enter in data about up to five food trucks, and then query that data. 

### Topics and Technologies

Scanner, System.in, encapsulation, methods, for loops. 

Objects - the only static method is the main() method.

### Lessons Learned
You can use methods inside of constructors!
